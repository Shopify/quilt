Update Apollo from v2 to v3. Replace dependencies on `apollo-client`, `apollo-cache-inmemory` `apollo-link` and `apollo-link-context` with `@apollo/client`. When updating to Apollo v3, `@shopify/graphql-persisted`, `@shopify/graphql-testing`, `@shopify/react-graphql` and `@shopify/react-graphql-universal-provider` should all be updated at the same time, and you should follow the [Apollo3 migration guide](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/react/migrating/apollo-client-3-migration/).
