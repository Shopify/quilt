### Fixed

- Fix typo in [error message](https://github.com/Shopify/quilt/blob/fefe904fe6e59f11c59092e523f6ee63ba1fd09d/gems/quilt_rails/lib/quilt_rails/react_renderable.rb#L56). ([#1528](https://github.com/Shopify/quilt/pull/1528))

## [3.1.0] - 2020-06-17

### Changed

- Remove automatic passing of `X-CSRF-Token` in the header. With [csrf header strategy](./README.md#fixing-rejected-csrf-tokens-for-new-user-sessions) you should not need this value for GraphQL request. If absolutely needed, use [custom headers method](./README.md#example:-sending-custom-headers-from-rails-controller) to pass the value manually. ([#1509](https://github.com/Shopify/quilt/pull/1509))

- Remove installation of `@shopify/react-server` from the generator. ([#1509](https://github.com/Shopify/quilt/pull/1509))

## [3.0.0] - 2020-06-10

## [2.0.0] - 2020-06-08
