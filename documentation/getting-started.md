# Getting started

## Technical foundation

We are adding documentation as we go in the [Web Foundations repo](https://github.com/Shopify/web-foundations). There you will find our [decision records](https://github.com/Shopify/web-foundations/tree/main/handbook/Decision%20Records), [principles](https://github.com/Shopify/web-foundations/tree/main/handbook/Principles), [best practices](https://github.com/Shopify/web-foundations/tree/main/handbook/Best%20Practices) and [styleguides](https://github.com/Shopify/web-foundations/tree/main/handbook/Styleguides) for writing and [testing](https://github.com/Shopify/web-foundations/blob/main/handbook/Best%20Practices/Testing.md) different kinds of components.

In addition to this documentation, Quilt contributors generally have an in-depth understanding of the following technologies:

- JavaScript
- TypeScript
- React
- Node.JS
- Jest

If you're looking to enhance your understanding of these technologies, fell free to reach out in `#web-foundation-tech` on Slack.

## Tools

The tools below will give you the best developer experience with this project:

### VSCode

[VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/) offers exceptional tooling for the stack we use in this project. This includes easy navigation to the definition of symbols, viewing all references to a given symbol, easy renaming across the project, built-in debugging, and more.

If you are using VSCode, you should first set it to use the workspace version of TypeScript. To do so, open VSCode's command palette (`cmd+shift+p`) and select `TypeScript: select TypeScript version`. In the prompt that opens, select `Use workspace version` if it is not already selected.

#### Extensions

Our recommended extensions for VSCode can be installed by opening the command palette (`cmd+shift+p`), and entering `Show Workspace Recommended Extensions`.
