## ‚ùóÔ∏è Deprecated on version 3.1.0 ‚ùóÔ∏è

**Note**: This module is now deprecated and included as part of [`@shopify/react-server`](../react-server/README.md#webpack-plugin).

<!-- ## [Unreleased] -->

## [3.1.0] - 2020-05-29

- Bump `webpack-virtual-modules` to `v0.2.2` [[#1484]](https://github.com/Shopify/quilt/pull/1484)

## [3.0.0] - 2020-05-12

### Changed

- ‚ö†Ô∏è Generated entrypoints no longer render the App component with a `location` prop. Apps can instead get the same data from the new `url` prop's `href` attribute.
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Generated entrypoints no longer render the `App` component with a `server` prop. Whether an app is rendered on the server can instead be trivially inferred from `typeof window === 'undefined'`

Apps which were using the `location` prop will need to use the `url` prop instead. Where before an app component might look like this

```tsx
export function App({location}: {location: string}) {
  return (
    <div className={styles.App}>
      <Router location={location}>
        <Frame>
          <Routes />
        </Frame>
      </Router>
    </div>
  );
}
```

It would now look like this

```tsx
export function App({url}: {url: URL}) {
  return (
    <div className={styles.App}>
      <Router location={url.href}>
        <Frame>
          <Routes />
        </Frame>
      </Router>
    </div>
  );
}
```

### Added

- Generated entrypoints now pass a `data` prop to the `App`. This prop contains the deserialized data from the `x-quilt-data` header which is used by `quilt_rails` to pass data directly to React
- Generated entrypoints now pass a `url` prop to the `App`. This prop is a full WHATWG compliant `URL` object representing the url for the request that react-server responded to.
