<-- ## [Unreleased] -->

## [0.16.0] - 2020-06-16

### Changed

- Move default options from webpack plugin into react-server. ([#1514](https://github.com/Shopify/quilt/pull/1514))

## [0.15.0] - 2020-06-06

### Changed

- ðŸ›‘ Replace `isomorphic-fetch` with `cross-fetch` as peer dependency. Consumer project should install `cross-fetch` in their project or use `@shopify/sewing-kit >= v0.131.0` ([#1497](https://github.com/Shopify/quilt/pull/1497))

## [0.14.0] - 2020-06-06

### Added

- Added `renderError` option to rendering a custom Error page on production SSR errors.

  - Note: If `renderError` is not set, the server returns a fallback error page as a sane default for production SSR errors.

- [webpack-plugin] Utilizes an `error` component if it exists at the root of `app/ui`. This component will be imported in the server source and passed to `@shopify/react-server`'s `renderError` option when creating a server. This will also create a virtual client entrypoint for the `error` component.

## [0.13.0] - 2020-06-04

### Changed

- Move `react-server-webpack-plugin` into `react-server` and expose it from `@shopify/react-server/webpack-plugin` ([#1489](https://github.com/Shopify/quilt/pull/1489))

## [0.12.0] - 2020-05-12

### Changed

- The `x-quilt-data` header is now serialized under the ID `quilt-data` rather than `x-quilt-data`

## [0.11.0] - 2020-05-04

### Changed

- Removed the providers that were previously exported. To our knowledge nothing used them and they offered little value. If cookie context is needed users can manually use `CookieUniversalProvider` from `@shopify/react-cookie`, and `CSRFProvider` should not be necessary with the new strategies provided by `quilt_rails`.

- Add: Serialize `x-quilt-data` received from the Rails server for use on the client ([#1411](https://github.com/Shopify/quilt/pull/1411))

## [0.10.0] - 2020-03-23
