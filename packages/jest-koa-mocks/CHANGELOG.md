# Changelog

## 5.0.0

### Major Changes

- [#2337](https://github.com/Shopify/quilt/pull/2337) [`e61e9a1e0`](https://github.com/Shopify/quilt/commit/e61e9a1e0aa6efd51ea79e7edf6b08d33503ff63) Thanks [@atesgoral](https://github.com/atesgoral)! - Update node-mocks-http, fixing response.getHeaders() behaviour

  response.getHeaders() had a flawed implementation where it exposed the
  underlying headers object, allowing it to be mutated in tests directly.
  https://github.com/howardabrams/node-mocks-http/pull/217 fixes that issue by
  returning a shallow copy so that the underlying headers object cannot be
  directly mutated.
