Tools for creating powerful, asynchronously-loaded React components.

## Installation

```bash
$ yarn add @shopify/react-async
```

## Usage

### `createAsyncComponent()`

`createAsyncComponent` is a function for creating components that are loaded asynchronously on initial mount. However, the resulting component does more than just help you split up your application along component lines; it also supports customized rendering for loading, and creates additional components for smartly preloading or preloading the component’s bundle. Best of all, in conjunction with the Babel and Webpack plugins provided by [`@shopify/async`](https://github.com/Shopify/quilt/tree/master/packages/async), you can easily extract the bundles needed to render your application during server side rendering.

To start, import the `createAsyncComponent` function. The simplest use of this function requires just a `load` function, which returns a promise for a component:

```tsx
import {createAsyncComponent} from '@shopify/react-async';

const MyComponent = createAsyncComponent({
  load: () => import('./MyComponent'),
});
```

This function returns a component that accepts the same props as the original one.

`createAsyncComponent` also adds a few static members that are themselves components: `Preload`, `Prefetch`, and `KeepFresh`.

```tsx
const MyComponent = createAsyncComponent({
  load: () => import('./MyComponent'),
});

// All of these are available:
<MyComponent />
<MyComponent.Prefetch />
<MyComponent.Preload />
<MyComponent.KeepFresh />
```

By default, `Preload`, `Prefetch`, and `KeepFresh` all simply prefetch the bundle for the component in the background. However, you can provide additional markup to render during these phases with the `renderPreload`, `renderPrefetch`, and `renderKeepFresh` options to `createAsyncComponent`:

```tsx
const MyComponent = createAsyncComponent({
  load: () => import('./MyComponent'),
  renderPrefetch: () => <PrefetchSomethingElse />,
});

// Now prefetches the component, and <PrefetchSomethingElse />!
<MyComponent.Prefetch />;
```

While you can supply whatever markup you like for these, we recommend that you use them for the following purposes:

- `Prefetch`: loading resources that will be used by the component
- `Preload`: loading resources **and** data that will be used by the component
- `KeepFresh`: loading resources and data that will be used by the component, and keeping data up to date

If you want props for your `Preload`, `Prefetch`, or `KeepFresh` components, simply provide them in the `render` option for that component. The resulting components will have those prop types baked in.

```tsx
const MyComponent = createAsyncComponent({
  load: () => import('./MyComponent'),
  renderPreload: ({priority}: {priority: 'high' | 'low'}) => (
    <PreloadSomethingElse priority={priority} />
  ),
});

// This is a type error, we need a `priority` prop!
<MyComponent.Preload />;

// Ah, much better!
<MyComponent.Preload priority="high" />;
```

This system is designed to work well with our [`@shopify/react-graphql` package](https://github.com/Shopify/quilt/tree/master/packages/react-graphql). Simply create an async GraphQL query using that library, and then `Prefetch`, `Preload`, and `KeepFresh` that component alongside the React component itself:

```tsx
const MyQuery = createAsyncComponent({
  load: () => import('./graphql/MyQuery.graphql'),
});

const MyComponent = createAsyncComponent({
  load: () => import('./MyComponent'),
  // If you use `graphql-typescript-definitions` for generating types from your
  // GraphQL documents, you'll be warned if there are required variables you aren’t
  // providing here!
  renderPrefetch: () => <MyQuery.Prefetch />,
  renderPreload: () => <MyQuery.Preload />,
  renderKeepFresh: () => <MyQuery.KeepFresh />,
});
```

### `Prepare`

The `Prepare` component allows you to use the asynchronous component you generated with `createAsyncComponent` and automatically render its `Prefetch` component when the user looks like they are going to navigate to a page that uses it. This component takes as its props the asynchronous component, a URL pattern to look for (a string or `RegExp` that is compared against the target pathname), and an optional function that can map the URL to a set of props for your prefetch component.

Consider this async component:

```tsx
const ProductDetails = createAsyncComponent({
  load: () => import('./ProductDetails'),
  renderPrefetch: ({id}: {id: string}) => <PrefetchGraphQLQuery id={id} />,
});
```

This component might be rendered when the URL matches `/products/:id`. If we want to prefetch this component (including its GraphQL query!) whenever the user is going to navigate to a matching URL, we would register this intent with the following `Prepare` component:

```tsx
<Prefetch
  component={ProductDetails}
  url={/^\/products\/(\d+)$/}
  mapUrlToProps={pathname => {
    // If you don’t pass the right types, or don’t pass mapUrlToProps()
    // at all, you’ll get a type error.
    const id = pathname.split('/').pop();
    return {id};
  }}
/>
```

And that’s it. While we reserve the right to change it, the basic process for determining merchant navigation intent is fairly simple. We listen for users mousing over or focusing in to elements with an `href` attribute (or, `data-href`, if you can’t use a real link) and, if the user doesn’t mouse/ focus out in some small amount of time, we prefetch all matching components. We also do the prefetch when the user begins their click on an element with an `href` attribute.

### `AsyncManager` and `AsyncProvider`

`AsyncManager` and `AsyncProvider` allow you to extract the asynchronous bundles that were required for your application. If you use the Babel plugin, every component created by `createAsyncComponent` will report its existence when rendered to an `AsyncManager`. So, on the server, you simply need to provide an `AsyncManager` to your app, render the app to a string, and then inspect the `AsyncManager`’s `used` property.

```tsx
import {AsyncManager, AsyncProvider} from '@shopify/react-async';

const asyncManager = new AsyncManager();

renderToString(
  <AsyncProvider manager={asyncManager}>
    <App />
  </AsyncProvider>,
);

const moduleIds = [...asyncManager.used];
```

These module IDs can be looked up in the manifest created by `@shopify/async`’s Webpack plugin. If you are using [`sewing-kit-koa`](https://github.com/Shopify/quilt/tree/master/packages/sewing-kit-koa), you can follow the instructions from that package to automatically collect the required JavaScript and CSS bundles.
