## 5.1.0

### Minor Changes

- [#2409](https://github.com/Shopify/quilt/pull/2409) [`0bff6fad7`](https://github.com/Shopify/quilt/commit/0bff6fad7b0630d1b796bb457d8d86e81ececedd) Thanks [@BPScott](https://github.com/BPScott)! - Update types to account changes in TypeScript 4.8 and 4.9. [Propogate contstraints on generic types](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/typescript/announcing-typescript-4-8/#unconstrained-generics-no-longer-assignable-to) and update type usage relating to `Window` and `Navigator`. Technically this makes some types stricter, as attempting to pass `null|undefined` into certain functions is now disallowed by TypeScript, but these were never expected runtime values in the first place.
