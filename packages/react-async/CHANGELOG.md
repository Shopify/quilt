## [Unreleased]

## 1.2.2 - 2019-02-27

### Fixed

- The library now performs a more exhaustive obfuscation of `require` to reliably fool Webpack ([#537](https://github.com/Shopify/quilt/pull/537))

## 1.2.1 - 2019-02-26

### Fixed

- Fixed an issue where Webpack would complain about a dynamic `require` statement ([#533](https://github.com/Shopify/quilt/pull/533))

## 1.2.0 - 2019-02-25

### Changed

- `Async` now attempts to resolve the `id` of the component with a bare `require` call when it is available ([#530](https://github.com/Shopify/quilt/pull/530))

## 1.1.0 - 2019-02-15

### Added

- `createAsyncComponent` now accepts a `defer` property that dictates whether that component should wait until mount or idle to start loading the component ([#517](https://github.com/Shopify/quilt/pull/517))
- The component returned from `createAsyncComponent` and its static `Preload`, `Prefetch`, and `KeepFresh` components all accept an `async` prop that is an object with an optional `defer` property, which controls the way loading is done for just that element ([#517](https://github.com/Shopify/quilt/pull/517))

## 1.0.2 - 2019-02-10
