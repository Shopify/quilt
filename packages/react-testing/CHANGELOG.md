## 1.8.0 - 2019-10-08

### Added

- new `debug()` function added to `Root` and `Element` to inspect mounted structure ([#1088](https://github.com/Shopify/quilt/pull/1088))

## 1.7.10 - 2019-09-30

### Fixed

- Fixed `html()` to properly return the outermost wrapping DOM tags ([#1042](https://github.com/Shopify/quilt/pull/1042))

## 1.7.9 - 2019-09-27

## 1.7.1 - 2019-07-16

### Fixed

- explicitly defining return type for `findWhere` and `findAllWhere` operators ([#795](https://github.com/Shopify/quilt/pull/795))

- Added a `toContainReactComponentTimes` matcher ([#781](https://github.com/Shopify/quilt/pull/781))
- Added the ability to extend a custom mount function with `createMount().extend()` ([#788](https://github.com/Shopify/quilt/pull/788))
- `Root` and `Element` now both implement the newly-exported `Node` type, which can be used to request any object that satisfies the traversal and introspection APIs ([#793](https://github.com/Shopify/quilt/pull/793))

## 1.6.0 - 2019-06-04

### Added

- Added a `toProvideReactContext` matcher ([#735](https://github.com/Shopify/quilt/pull/735))

## 1.5.4 - 2019-05-31

### Fixed

- When using a custom mount with `createMount`, calling `setProps` on the resulting elements will now properly set props on the JSX that was mounted, not the element returned from the `createMount` `render` option ([#726](https://github.com/Shopify/quilt/pull/726)).

  > **Note**: In order to support the above, a small change was made to the `Root` classâ€™s constructor. If you were calling this directly (which is discouraged), you will need to use the new `resolveRoot` option instead of the existing second argument. Additionally, if you were manually passing through additional props in a component you used to wrap elements in `createMount.render`, you can now remove this workaround.

## 1.5.3 - 2019-05-22

## 1.3.2 - 2019-04-09

### Fixed

- Fixed an issue were a leaf DOM node would return `null` for `domNode` ([#622](https://github.com/Shopify/quilt/pull/622))

- Added `.toContainReactText` and `.toContainReactHtml` matchers ([#626](https://github.com/Shopify/quilt/pull/626))
