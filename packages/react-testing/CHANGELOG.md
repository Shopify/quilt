## 1.8.0 - 2019-10-08

### Added

- new `debug()` function added to `Root` and `Element` to inspect mounted structure ([#1088](https://github.com/Shopify/quilt/pull/1088))

## 1.7.10 - 2019-09-30

### Fixed

- Fixed `html()` to properly return the outermost wrapping DOM tags ([#1042](https://github.com/Shopify/quilt/pull/1042))

## 1.7.9 - 2019-09-27

### Changed

- Both `toContainReactComponent` and `toContainReactComponentTimes` matcher will now throw a more useful error if the expected value is `null` or `undefined` ([#1047](https://github.com/Shopify/quilt/pull/1047))

## 1.7.6 - 2019-08-27

### Fixed

- Fixed `find` and `findAll` not returning the correct type when being passed a string that matches `JSX.IntrinsicElements` ([#906](https://github.com/Shopify/quilt/pull/906))

## 1.7.1 - 2019-07-16

### Fixed

- explicitly defining return type for `findWhere` and `findAllWhere` operators ([#795](https://github.com/Shopify/quilt/pull/795))

## 1.7.0 - 2019-07-15

### Added

- Added a `toContainReactComponentTimes` matcher ([#781](https://github.com/Shopify/quilt/pull/781))
- Added the ability to extend a custom mount function with `createMount().extend()` ([#788](https://github.com/Shopify/quilt/pull/788))
- `Root` and `Element` now both implement the newly-exported `Node` type, which can be used to request any object that satisfies the traversal and introspection APIs ([#793](https://github.com/Shopify/quilt/pull/793))

## 1.6.0 - 2019-06-04

### Added

- Added a `toProvideReactContext` matcher ([#735](https://github.com/Shopify/quilt/pull/735))

## 1.5.4 - 2019-05-31

### Fixed

- When using a custom mount with `createMount`, calling `setProps` on the resulting elements will now properly set props on the JSX that was mounted, not the element returned from the `createMount` `render` option ([#726](https://github.com/Shopify/quilt/pull/726)).

  > **Note**: In order to support the above, a small change was made to the `Root` classâ€™s constructor. If you were calling this directly (which is discouraged), you will need to use the new `resolveRoot` option instead of the existing second argument. Additionally, if you were manually passing through additional props in a component you used to wrap elements in `createMount.render`, you can now remove this workaround.

## 1.5.3 - 2019-05-22

### Fixed

## 1.4.0 - 2019-04-18

### Changed

- `Root/Element#trigger()` now allow passing a deep partial version of the arguments of the prop being triggered ([#661](https://github.com/Shopify/quilt/pull/661))

## 1.3.2 - 2019-04-09

### Fixed

## 1.3.0 - 2019-04-02

- Added `.toContainReactText` and `.toContainReactHtml` matchers ([#626](https://github.com/Shopify/quilt/pull/626))

### Changed

- Calling `Root#act` within another callback to `Root#act` now groups the update into a single `act()` block ([#626](https://github.com/Shopify/quilt/pull/626))
