## [Unreleased]

## [1.6.0] - 2019-06-04

### Added

- Added a `toContainReactComponentTimes` matcher ([781](https://github.com/Shopify/quilt/pull/781))
- Added a `toProvideReactContext` matcher ([#735](https://github.com/Shopify/quilt/pull/735))

## [1.5.4] - 2019-05-31

### Fixed

- When using a custom mount with `createMount`, calling `setProps` on the resulting elements will now properly set props on the JSX that was mounted, not the element returned from the `createMount` `render` option ([#726](https://github.com/Shopify/quilt/pull/726)).

  > **Note**: In order to support the above, a small change was made to the `Root` classâ€™s constructor. If you were calling this directly (which is discouraged), you will need to use the new `resolveRoot` option instead of the existing second argument. Additionally, if you were manually passing through additional props in a component you used to wrap elements in `createMount.render`, you can now remove this workaround.
