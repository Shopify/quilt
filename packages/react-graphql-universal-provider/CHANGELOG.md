## [Unreleased]

### Fixed

- Removed an unnecessary part of the `GraphQLUniversalProvider` component that broke when using `react-apollo@3.x` ([#1087](https://github.com/Shopify/quilt/pull/1087))

## 2.0.0 - 2019-09-13

- ðŸ›‘ Breaking change: `GraphQLUniversalProvider` expects a `createClientOptions` prop and will create ApolloClient using the options provided [#1039](https://github.com/Shopify/quilt/pull/1039)

## 1.1.0 - 2019-09-13

### Added

- By default included <ApolloBridge /> from [`@shopify/react-effect-apollo`](../react-effect-apollo). This is needed if the consumer is using `Query` component from `react-apollo` or `@shopify/react-graphql` ([#994](https://github.com/Shopify/quilt/pull/994))

## 1.0.0 - 2019-08-28

### Added

- `@shopify/react-graphql-universal-provider` package
