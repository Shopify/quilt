## 6.4.0 - 2020-12-18

## 6.3.6 - 2020-10-20

## 6.3.0 - 2020-02-03

- [Patch] If the requested variant locale is not found, the parent locale's manifest will be returned [#1254](https://github.com/Shopify/quilt/pull/1254)

## 6.2.0 - 2019-11-29

### Added

- [Minor] If an `assets.json.gz` file exists, it will be read and unzipped ([1199](https://github.com/Shopify/quilt/pull/1199))
- [Minor] Manifests may now contain an `identity` attribute; this contains extra metadata about a manifest's support (e.g., locales) ([1199](https://github.com/Shopify/quilt/pull/1199))
- [Minor] A `locale` can now be passed to `assets` / `asyncAssets` / `script` / `style` helpers. If a locale is provided, and manifests with a matching `identity.locales` array are found, locale-specific assets will be returned.
  - Note: use `@shopify/react-i18n` and its `from-generated-index` mode to create locale-specific builds

## 6.0.1 - 2019-07-10

### Fixed

- The library now loads scripts in development, even when only styles are requested. This fixes the fact that, in development, there are no explicit styles, and they are instead injected by the associated script. ([#782](https://github.com/Shopify/quilt/pull/782))

## 6.0.0 - 2019-07-03

### Changed

- Removed a number of unnecessary methods from `assets`, and allowed passing identifiers for async assets that can selectively omit styles or scripts ([#762](https://github.com/Shopify/quilt/pull/762))

## 5.0.0 - 2019-06-07

- **Breaking Change:** The `assets` property is now only accessible via a new function, `getAssets(ctx: Context)`, and set via `setAssets(ctx: Context, assets: Assets)`. [#743](https://github.com/Shopify/quilt/pull/743)

## 4.0.0 - 2019-06-05
