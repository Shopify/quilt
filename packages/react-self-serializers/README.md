## Self serializers

A self-serializer is a React component that leverages the `useSerialized()` hook from `@shopify/react-html` to handle both serializing data during server rendering, and deserializing it on the client. The components often render `React.context()` providers to make their serialized state available to the rest of the app they're rendered in.

### Comparison with traditional serialization techniques

Consider the `I18n` self-serializer. In the server you may want to set the locale based on the `Accept-Language` header. The client needs to be informed of this somehow to make sure React can render consistently. Traditionally you might do something like:

#### On the server

- get the locale from the `Accept-Language` header in your node server
- create an instance of `I18nManager` with that locale
- pass the instance into your app
- render a `<Serialize name="locale" />` component in the DOM you send to the client

#### On the client

- call `getSerialized('locale')` in your client entrypoint for your locale
- create an instance of `I18nManager` with that locale
- pass the instance into your app

#### In your react app's universal code

- have your app render an `<I18nProvider />` with the manager from props

With self-serializers you would instead:

#### On the server

- get the locale from the `Accept-Language` header in your node server
- pass the locale into your app directly

#### On the client

- render your app without passing in the locale

#### In your react app's universal code

- have your app render an `<I18n />` with the locale from props

Since self-serializers handle the details of serialization they allow you to remove code from your client/server entrypoints and instead let the react app itself handle those concerns.

## API

### I18n

A self-serializing provider for `@shopify/i18n`'s I18nManager.

#### Props

The component takes an object containing the React children to render and any options to use when configuring the `I18nManager` to provide to the tree.

```tsx
interface Props {
  locale?: string;
  country?: string;
  currency?: string;
  timezone?: string;
  pseudolocalize?: boolean;
  fallbackLocale?: string;
  onError?: ((error: I18nError) => void);
  children?: React.ReactNode;
}
```

#### Example

```tsx
// App.tsx
import {I18n} from '@shopify/react-self-serializers';

function App({locale}: {locale?: string}) {
  return <I18n locale={locale}>{/* rest of the app */}</I18n>;
}
```

### GraphQL

A self-serializing provider for initial GraphQL data from Apollo.

#### Props

The component takes an object containing the React children to render and any options to use when creating the GraphQL client.

#### Example

```tsx
interface Props {
  shop?: string;
  server?: boolean;
  accessToken?: string;
  graphQLEndpoint?: string;
  connectToDevTools?: boolean;
  children?: React.ReactNode;
}
```

```tsx
// App.tsx
import {GraphQL} from '@shopify/react-self-serializers';

function App({shop, accessToken}: {shop?: string; accessToken?: string}) {
  return (
    <GraphQL shop={shop} accessToken={accessToken}>
      {/* rest of the app */}
    </GraphQL>
  );
}
```
