- [#2608](https://github.com/Shopify/quilt/pull/2608) [`ba4da84d5`](https://github.com/Shopify/quilt/commit/ba4da84d5237603433f8097f79421bab6ea48f86) Thanks [@BPScott](https://github.com/BPScott)! - Use `import type` everywhere that we deal with importing types

## 7.0.0

### Major Changes

- [#2302](https://github.com/Shopify/quilt/pull/2302) [`96a5023e7`](https://github.com/Shopify/quilt/commit/96a5023e7106b91089e29c6a9826948b62bde150) Thanks [@vsumner](https://github.com/vsumner)! - Update Apollo from v2 to v3. Replace dependencies on `apollo-client`, `apollo-cache-inmemory` and `apollo-link` with `@apollo/client`. When updating to Apollo v3, `@shopify/graphql-persisted`, `@shopify/graphql-testing`, `@shopify/react-graphql` and `@shopify/react-graphql-universal-provider` should all be updated at the same time, and you should follow the [Apollo3 migration guide](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/react/migrating/apollo-client-3-migration/).

  Remove `assumeImmutableResults` and `unionOrIntersectionTypes` keys from `createGraphQLFactory()`'s options, as these concepts no longer exist in Apollo 3. Cache behavior can be controlled by setting values within the `cacheOptions` key, which is passed to [the cache constructor](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/react/caching/cache-configuration/#configuration-options). Use [`possibleTypes`](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/react/migrating/apollo-client-3-migration/#breaking-cache-changes) in place of `unionOrIntersectionTypes`.

  Remove the ability to filter operations using `operationName` (e.g. `graphQL.operations.all({operationName: 'SampleQuery'})`). Now operations must be filtered using `query` or `mutation` keys.

  Add `graphQL.waitForQueryUpdates()` method to wait for batched cache updates that occur as of Apollo 3.6.0. This is useful if you need to await on the results of a `fetchMore` call.

  Remove internal `TestingApolloClient` - use `ApolloClient` instead.

  Apollo Change: The task/microtask resolution within Apollo has changed slightly, with some behaviors happening slightly later in the event loop than in Apollo 2. This has no visible effect in the browser, but `@shopify/graphql-testing` is very sensitive to these changes. To get some tests passing you may require additional task/microtask queue flushes.

- [#2595](https://github.com/Shopify/quilt/pull/2595) [`93ec0a0e5`](https://github.com/Shopify/quilt/commit/93ec0a0e57a1962a455f15a46977a3c05a02369f) Thanks [@BPScott](https://github.com/BPScott)! - Use `import type` when importing types

### Minor Changes

- [#2543](https://github.com/Shopify/quilt/pull/2543) [`7c8b83134`](https://github.com/Shopify/quilt/commit/7c8b831346ec84150dd8ed178741b39408fb0fe8) Thanks [@acmertz](https://github.com/acmertz)! - Update resolveAll() to accept a custom filter option to selectively resolve requests.

## 6.4.0

### Minor Changes

- [#2486](https://github.com/Shopify/quilt/pull/2486) [`51c0434a9`](https://github.com/Shopify/quilt/commit/51c0434a92134f375bd1fbfd3003bcb5e4d38d06) Thanks [@BPScott](https://github.com/BPScott)! - Deliberatly cause a `NetworkError` with a useful error message if we see a fixture that is a function that returns a function. This can happen if you do `createGraphQL({MyQuery: () => fillGraphQL(MyQuery)})` because fillGraphQL returns a function. Apollo 2 already returns a `NetworkError` if you do this but as it happens later on, the error message was much less helpful.

## 6.3.0

### Minor Changes

- [#2479](https://github.com/Shopify/quilt/pull/2479) [`1f2f7da72`](https://github.com/Shopify/quilt/commit/1f2f7da72dc8db2cc2318521cabc61072fdc4edc) Thanks [@BPScott](https://github.com/BPScott)! - Improve error that is thrown when you test a GraphQL operation that has not been mocked. It now details what mock was absent.

  Calling `createGraphQL()` with no argument now results in the operation returning a NetworkError. This makes it consistent with the error that results from `createGraphQL({})`.
