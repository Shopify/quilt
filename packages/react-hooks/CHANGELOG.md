## 2.0.0 - 2021-05-21

### Breaking Change

- Update minimum supported node version to 12.14.0. Add engines field to help enforce usage of this version. [#1906](https://github.com/Shopify/quilt/pull/1906)

## 1.13.1 - 2021-04-13

### Changed

- Removed dependency on tslib, as we no-longer compile with `tsc`. [#1829](https://github.com/Shopify/quilt/pull/1829)

## 1.13.0 - 2021-04-07

- Added `useIsomorphicLayoutEffect` hook [#1813](https://github.com/Shopify/quilt/pull/1813).
- Updated `useLazyRef` hook implementation to avoid mutating refs directly during the render phase, which is unsafe [#1813](https://github.com/Shopify/quilt/pull/1813).
- Updated `useTimeout` and `useInterval` hooks. Both of these hooks use mutable ref to hold on to the latest callback function. Now updating this ref synchronously to avoid stale callbacks being invoked [#1813](https://github.com/Shopify/quilt/pull/1813).

### Fixed

- Updated multi-build outputs to include mandatory extensions to fix "Module not found" issues reported by ESM supported bundlers [#1759](https://github.com/Shopify/quilt/pull/1759)

## 1.12.0 - 2020-12-18

### Added

## 1.11.1 - 2020-08-19

### Fixed

- `useDelayedCallback` now uses `useRef` instead of `useState` in to avoid unnecessary re-render ([#1600](https://github.com/Shopify/quilt/pull/1600))
- Improved test case for `useDelayedCallback` ([#1601](https://github.com/Shopify/quilt/pull/1601))

## 1.6.0 - 2020-03-02

### Added

- Added support for `null` `delay` argument to `useTimeout`, to clear the timeout ([#1306](https://github.com/Shopify/quilt/pull/1306))

### Fixed

- Improved `useTimeout` hook, so it doesn't reset the timeout if the `callback` changes ([#1306](https://github.com/Shopify/quilt/pull/1306))
