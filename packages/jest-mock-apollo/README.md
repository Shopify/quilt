Jest + Enzyme mocks for Apollo 2.x.

## Installation

```bash
$ yarn add @shopify/jest-mock-apollo
```

## Setup

This package provides a decorator for building mock GraphQL clients specific to your project. The initial function call takes in project-wide configuration and emits a customized decorator to be used across your project. For example:

```ts
// tests/utilities/graphql.ts
import {buildSchema} from 'graphql';
import configureClient from '@shopify/jest-mock-apollo';

// You likely want to import this from somewhere in real production code
const schemaSrc = `
  type Product {
    id: Int!
    title: String
  }

  type Query {
    products: [Product]
  }
`;
const schema = buildSchema(schemaSrc);

const createGraphQLClient = configureClient({schema});

export {createGraphQLClient};
```

The factory requires a `GraphQLSchema` (`schema`) in order to ensure that more useful error messages are shown and that mocks are validated against the schema.

## Example Usage

Take a look at the test suite for examples on how to use enzyme's mock context.
