## 3.3.4 - 2021-04-13

- Specify package has no `sideEffects` ([#1233](https://github.com/Shopify/quilt/pull/1233))

## 3.2.0 - 2019-06-27

### Fixed

- Fixed an issue where `betweenEachPass` was called on the last pass before `maxPasses` was reached. In order to correct this issue, returning `false` from `betweenEachPass` no longer halts render looping (use `afterEachPass` instead). [#769](https://github.com/Shopify/quilt/pull/769)

## 3.1.0 - 2019-06-14

### Added

- You can now bail out of render passes in `extract` by returning `false` (or a promise that resolves to `false`) from `betweenEachPass`/ `afterEachPass` ([#747](https://github.com/Shopify/quilt/pull/747))

## 3.0.0 - 2019-04-08

This library now requires React 16.8.

### Added

- Added a `useServerEffect` hook as an alternative to the `<Effect />` component ([#547](https://github.com/Shopify/quilt/pull/547))

## 2.1.0

### Added

- Added a `maxPasses` option to `extract()` in order to limit the potential for infinite loops. This option defaults to 5 max render/ resolve cycles [#574](https://github.com/Shopify/quilt/pull/574)
- All `afterEachPass`/ `betweenEachPass` callbacks now receive an argument detailing the current pass index, whether the extraction process is complete, and the duration of the render/ resolve phases [#574](https://github.com/Shopify/quilt/pull/574)

## 2.0.0

### Changed

- Removed `react-tree-walker` as a way to process the React element. Instead, the application is rendered to a string repeatedly until no more promises have been queued. For full details on migrating to the new API, please read the [upgrade guide](./documentation/migrating-version-1-to-2.md). [#477](https://github.com/Shopify/quilt/pull/477)
